Then i understand data are which is accepted and not acctepted from the complier. I understand that complier is work based on boolean method . Then mentor gave assignment to each team to write the datastructure in different topic and he gave as conference room to create the data structure for the conference room. Me and my team members are discussed and create the data structure by what is need for the confernce room and we write down the requirements for the conference room

	Then mentor gave us another problem for to create the data structure for the library and table. we create the data structure by the possible way as we create the data structure.

	Then mentor taught as how to create the datastructure by the acutal representation by the dimension, base, decorative item and equpiments. Then we try the datastructure of library which leads to wrong datastructure and sriram helps to how to create the datastructure by first identify the object and find the object which have array and create the object for the array which is followed as the datastructure and mentor gave us an assignment to create the datastructure for the "swiggy" app and we are try to create the possible ways for the app in the datastructure. In the datastructure we list out hotels, menu, food, conformation message and cart list.
