<h2>Problem solving</h2>

<p>My mentor gave me three problems to solve which are solved and should be the result is given in algorithm.</p>

<p>Those problems are</p>

<h2>First Problem</h2>

<h3>Harry potter have lot of galleons, 5000 stickles and 5000 knuts. He going to buy the Broom stick at the price of 25 galleons. The constrainsts are</h3>
<ol>
<li>He spent upto one third of Galleon</li>

<li>He uses of sickles and knuts</li> 

<li>He use knuts more than other stickles and galleons</li>
</ol>
<h3>Value of money</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 galleons is equal to 17 stickles</li>

<li>1 stickles is equal to 29 kunts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Algorithm for the problem</h3>
<ol>
<li>Step 1 : Store stickles to galleons by dividing the 5000 stickles by 17. I will get 294 Galleons.</li>

<li>Step 2 : Store the knuts to stickles by dividing 5000 knuts by 29 is equal to 172.4 stickles</li>

<li>Step 3 : Store 172.4 stickles to galleons by dividing by 17 is equal to 10.14 galleos

( we got the knuts to galleons value which is subtract to find the balanace value of stickles and galleons)</li>

<li>Step 4 : Store Subtract 10.14 in 25 is equal to 14.86 Galleons</li>

<li>Step 5 : Store Galleons into Stickles by multipling 17 in 14.86 is equal to 252.62</li>
</ol>
<h2>Second Problem</h2>

<p>Table should be put at the corner and table should be cheaper, it is able to sit 4 to 6 peoples and should not draw the attention</p>

<h3>Option | Cost | Seating | size</h3>
<ul>
<li>  1    |600   |  6	    | 2.5 m^2</li>
<li>  2	   |500   |  4	    | 1.5 m^2</li>
<li>  3    |550	  |  5	    | 2 m^2</li>
<li>  4	   |450	  |  6 	    | 4 m^2</li>
<li>  5	   |300	  |  4	    | 2 m^2</li>
<li>  6	   |550	  |  5	    | 2 m^2</li>
</ul>

<h3>Algorithm of the problem</h3>
<ul>
<li>Step 1 : Store the ascending order of the cost because of applying first constraints which is the table should cheaper</li>

<li>Step 2 : Store the descending order of the seating capacity because of applying second constraints which is able to seating 4 to 6 people</li>

<li>Step 3 : Store the ascending order of the Size because of applying thrid constraints which is table should not draw attention</li>

<li>Step 4 : By arranging the orders which are created by the constraints</li>
</ul>

<h3>Option  |  Cost  |  Seating  |  Size</h3>
<ul>
<li>  1	    |  300   |     6	 |  1.5</li>
<li>  2	    |  450   |     6     |   2</li>
<li>  3	    |  500   |     5     |   2</li>
<li>  4	    |  550   |     5     |   2</li>
<li>  5	    |  550   |     4     |   2</li>
<li>  6	    |  600   |     4     |   4</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</li>Step 5 : Comparing arranged table and given table, the similar value is answer </li>
</ul>
<h2>Third Problem</h2>

<p>Tom reach jerry by the nodes which are inter connect with each nodes. The Nodes are a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i. To find the shortest path for tom to reach the jerry</p>

<h2>Algorithm of the problem</h2>
<ol>
<li>Step 1 : Start the program</li>

<li>Step 2 : Store the nodes of the map</li>

<li>Step 3 : Store the path of the map</li>

<li>Step 4 : Store the value of the path in the map</li>

<li>Step 5 : Find the shortest path</li>

<li>Step 6 : Store node a, b, c, g, h and value is 25</li>

<li>Step 7 : Store node a, b, c, f, h and value is 18</li>

<li>Step 8 : Store node a, b, c, f, i, h and value is 19</li>

<li>Step 9 : Store node a, b, c, i, h and value is 24</li>

<li>Step 10 : Store node a, d, e, f, h and value is 19</li>

<li>Step 11 : Store nodes a, d, c, g, h and value is 26</li>

<li>Step 12 : Store nodes a, b, e, f, h and value is 18</li>

<li>Step 13 : Store nodes a, b, e, i, h and value is 24</li>

<li>Step 14 : Store nodes a, d, e, g, h and value is 18</li>

<li>Step 15 : Store nodes a, d, e, i, f, h and value is 32</li>

<li>Step 16 : Store nodes a, b, c, f, i, h and value is 15</li>

<li>Step 17 : Store nodes a, b, c, f, h and value is 18</li>

<li>Step 18 : Store nodes a, b, c, f, i, h and value is 14</li>

<li>Step 19 : Store nodes a, b, c, g, e, i, h and value is 37</l>

<li>Step 20 : Store smallest value as shortest path </li>
