# Day23

	Today we learned about the fucntion which is used to assign variable as function. Function is keyword in the script it assign in the array or object.

	And also i have learned that in javascript loop ,how the while loop formed and how the loops are used,loops is the quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.The curly braces we used in a program to define the function is called blocks. I have learned to write a program by using while loop for printing the given numbers in reverse,the given number was [0,1,2,3,4,5], 

		*program is 
			* let a=[0,1,2,3,4,5] 
			* let i=a.length-1; 
			* let j=[] 
			* let j=0 
			* while(i>=0) 
			* { 
				* rev[j]=a[i] j++; 
				* i=i-1; 
			* }
			*  console.log(j)

		By the adding function in this data structure it will form a function.

			* function reverse ()
			* let rev = [];
			* let i = a.length-1;
			* let j = 0;
			* while (i>-1)
			* {
			* rev [j]=a(i)];
			* i--;
			* j++;
			* }
			* console.log (rev);
			* }
			* reverse (0,1,2,3,4,5);

		This script is working under the "function" by giving the input outside of the script and it executes the in the script.
