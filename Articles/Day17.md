# Day17

	Today i recollected again about what i learned from last three weeks and mentor taught about the software training and how it's related from the fundamental skills. Mentor asked about why i didn't practice the typing which is also the basics for sowftware delvoping.

	Then he asked about assignment which is try write own language and me and my team give the solution for assignmnets. Then i learned about the basic electronics and binary code which is base for hexa code. The Unicodes are based in the hexa decimal and it converts into the binary code for execute the word in the computer and shows in the monitor and mentor said about to create the unicode for our own language which is to execute and display in the computer.

	Then i tried to implement the IRC sever in the CentOS and i got error which is unsolved in the linux and tried to figure out the error and to create the IRC server in the linux.
