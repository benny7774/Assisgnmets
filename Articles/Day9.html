<h1>Day9 Article</h1>

	Today, I learned about the unsolved problem which is solved by algorithm. I learned the addition algorithm and how i create the algorithm for the computer which is didn't know the process of addition. The mentor is solve the solution by the Recursion method and i understand the concept of the algorithm and i didn't to know about to create a new algorithm.

	The mentor taught another method which was created by the sriram in surfboard which is simple to understand and easy method to implement the algorithm.

	Then the mentor start the cultral talk
