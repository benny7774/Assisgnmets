# Day21

	Today i learnead how to create the array and object in the class and how it is work. Then how to use the string literal in the syntax and how syntax works. In the syntax we declared as ( pb-ida-pk-value-ps-pb) otherwise it shows error. In value it consists of null literal, string literal, objects, Array, Imdividuals ( boolean, Null, undefined ).In array syntax (pa-val-ps-pa-pt). In a class it consists object and arrays we can defined the many arrays and objects in a single class.

	For example mentor taught as how to create the class and we use the string and continue the syntax by using the special charachter and the special character is ",". Then mentor gave assignment to create the syntax by the learned syntax and i try to create the syntax in the web browser by open the inspect mode. I tried to create the  syntax with the class consists of the objects and arrays. Then i tried to make an array then again create another array which is for string in the array.


	I try to learn the nmap for reconnaissance test in the network and i figure out the commands for testing the network by finding ip, ports, subnet  by the nmap in kali linux.
