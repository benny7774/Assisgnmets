# Weekly Report-1

## Day1

	I learned in internship on my day1 which was how to be software engineer and i learned the fundamentals which are listed below

		* Writing
		* Reading
		* Problem Solving
		* Mathematical Thinking
		* Researching
		* Breakdown down and Sythesis
		* Typing
		* Creativity

	Then i learned how to work in the linux by using the terminal in centOS 7 and i learned few basic commands. Basic commands are used to create folders and files and to view and edit the text files in the terminal.
	
		* ls
		* ln
		* cd
		* ../
		* sudo
		* cp

	I change the terminal mode to GUI mode by the terminal command. then i learned about to create and edit the file by using terminal and i have to highlight to the headers and point out the lists.

		* ":w" - save
		* ":q" - quit
		* ":wq" - save and quit
		* "u" - undo
		* "ctrl + r" -redo
		* "G" - go to bottom of the line
		* "gg" - go to top of the line
		* "^" - go to first of the line
		* "&" - go to end of the line


## Day2

	I learned on day2 was the problem solving techniques which is majorly used in the software developing. Mentor gave a problem which was " A man has a fox, a goose and a bag of corn. He cross the bridge with any one of his property. He have some problems which are fox and goose shouldn't together where fox eat goose and goose and corn are shouldn't together because goose eat the corn. Man should the solve the problem to cross the river with his propertyshould the solve the problem to cross the river with his propertyshould the solve the problem to cross the river with his property."
 By this problem i learned about " to the solve the problem by the rules." The following rules which are 

		* Understand the problem, Don't avoid the problem
		* Identify or list the constraints
		* List all possible operation
		* Arrange the operation to form a solution

	Then i learned the mathematical thinking by solving the problem of arrange the 1 to 35 with the sum of two is should be a perfect square. By this problem i learned rules how to solve the problem

		* Identify the maxium perfect square 	
		* List all possible squares
		* Start from Descending or Ascending

	Then i solve the sliding puzzle which is consists of 1 to 8 in the 3x3 box and i solved in 12 steps but the mentor solved by some tips. Those i learned are

		* Identify the train
		* Rotate clockwise from second column to third column and rotate anti-clockwise from first column to thrid column
		* Until desired configuration
	These are tips which is used to solve the problem

		* Most constrained ports
		* Trial and error
		* Breakdown the problem
		* stratergy

	Then i learned to use GitHub and we create the account and repository. Configure in linux using terminal, then push the Assignments to GitHub Repository

## Day3

	I learned the today, when the mentor say a word, which word is represent in mind is the answer what we understand about the word. A problem was gave by the mentor is about to solve by the Quarassi lock problem. I use the tips which was gave by the mentor and he give extra tip on the rule to solve the problem

	Then mentor gave a problem which is not solve by the constraints. then he taught has how to solve by euler's rule

	Then gave solution for software 

			* Scalibilty Problem - limited capability network to handle large amount of transaction data
			* Resource Constraint problem - sub-class of scheduling problem
			* Domain problem - area of expertise or application to analyze and solve problem

## Day4

	My mentor taught about markup and mark down language and how wrote the language in the terimal and which format is to be saved.

	The Markdown language are complied in YAML, XML and HTML

## Day5

	I learned how to install virtualbox and vmware. They have errors which i try to solve the errors by researching in the browser.
