# Network Protocol

Network protocols are a set of rules, conventions, and data structures that dictate how devices exchange data across networks.

Types od protocol

DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

	DHCP is a communication protocol that enables network administrators to automate the assignment of IP addresses in a network. In an IP network, every device connecting to the internet requires a unique IP.

DNS: Domain Name System protocol

	The DNS protocol helps in translating or mapping host names to IP addresses. DNS works on a client-server model, and uses a distributed database over a hierarchy of name servers.

FTP: File Transfer Protocol

	File Transfer Protocol enables file sharing between hosts, both local and remote, and runs on top of TCP. For file transfer, FTP creates two TCP connections: control and data connection. The control connection is used to transfer control information like passwords, commands to retrieve and store files, etc., and the data connection is used to transfer the actual file. Both of these connections run in parallel during the entire file transfer process.

HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

	HTTP is an application layer protocol used for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It works on a client-server model, where the web browser acts as the client. Data such as text, images, and other multimedia files are shared over the World Wide Web using HTTP. 

IMAP and IMAP4: Internet Message Access Protocol (version 4)

	IMAP is an email protocol that lets end users access and manipulate messages stored on a mail server from their email client as if they were present locally on their remote device.

POP and POP3: Post Office Protocol (version 3)

	The Post Office Protocol is also an email protocol. Using this protocol, the end user can download emails from the mail server to their own email client.

SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

	SMTP is a protocol designed to transfer electronic mail reliably and efficiently. SMTP is a push protocol and is used to send the email, whereas POP and IMAP are used to retrieve emails on the end user's side.

Telnet: Terminal emulation protocol

	Telnet is an application layer protocol that enables a user to communicate with a remote device. A Telnet client is installed on the user's machine, which accesses the command line interface of another remote machine that runs a Telnet server program.

SNMP: Simple Network Management Protocol

	SNMP is an application layer protocol used to manage nodes, like servers, workstations, routers, switches, etc., on an IP network. SNMP enables network admins to monitor network performance, identify network glitches, and troubleshoot them. SNMP protocol is comprised of three components: a managed device, an SNMP agent, and an SNMP manager.
