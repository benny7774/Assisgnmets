#Problem Solving
We are learned today about Problem solving in our Internship. First we saw the mathepatical thinking problem was my childhood riddle a man with fox, goose and corn in the river side need to cross the river to another by the boat. The boat can carry man and one animal. He must separate fox, goose and corn to cross the river because man take corn cross the river with corn then fox eat goose and  if carry the fox then goose will eat corn. So, we help the man to solve the problem avoiding eating by one and another. Our fundamental mentor separate us team which consists of two member and to solve this riddle. I assign team joshua who was my roommate. Then we solve with in the second because i already told that was my childhood riddle. The solution for this riddle is by the seven steps
	
	* The Man has to carry the goose first to cross the river because of fox didn't eat the corn
	* then he return to where he came from
	* He carry the fox to cross the river
	* then he leave the fox carry back goose to where he came from because the fox eat goose 
	* then he leave goose and carry corn to cross the river
	* Then he leave corn with fox and return where he came from
	* He carry the goose and he cross with fox, goose and corn which are not eat from one another
The purpose of this riddle is not to avoid the problem and we think about the solution of the problem. This was we learned from mentor to solve the problem with problem solving.

The problem solving are followed by these rules which are

	* Understand the problem, Don't avoid the problem
	* Identify or List the constraints
	* List all possible operations 
	* Arrange the operation to form a solution

#Mathematical Thinking
We are learned mathematical thinking and mentor gives us a problem and we strart to solve the a problem as a team of four. The problem was 1 to 35 which are arrange and the sum of two number will be a perfect square. For e.g., 12 4 32 when 12 + 4 is 16 and 4 + 32 is 36, both 16 and 36 are perfect square. So, we are formup as team and start to solve the problem. First i think and give solution by applying some number which is gives perfect square and we start solving the problem which is stack at the some number. Then we separate from creating new solution to avoid stack and to get the solution. I make addtion format table which is give perfect square root. Then my teammate get an idea and he call us to join with his solution. then we are teamup and start to solve the problem. Finally, we got the solution.

1 3 13 23 26 10 6 19 30 34 15 21 28 8 17 32 4 12 24 25 11  20 29 35 14 22 27 9 16 33 31 18 7 2

This is the solution which is solved as team.Then mentor gives three step solution

	* Identify maximum perfect square
	* List all possible squares
	* Start from Ascending or Descending

Then Mentor taught sudoku how we solve the sudoku which one is solved in the white board by the mentor and my teammate Anoop taught to rest of our teamamte.

Then Mentor gives sliding puzzle which is consists of 1 to 8 and consists of 9 boxes and i solve the problem with 12 steps. Then mentor ask me to explain how i solve the problem? i explained to him suddenly i noted i forgot to write a step and i go back to note that which i skiped. Then mentor taught us train stragery which is

	* Identify the train
	* Rotate clockwise from second column and third column and rotate anticlockwise from first column to third column
	* Until desired configurated
Then he gave some tips for us which are

	* Most constrained port
	* Trial and error
	* Break down the problem
	* Stratergy
#Github
We are going to signup an account in Github via https://www.github/signup. then i signup an account for which username was benny7774 and i created respository named as "assignmets" actually is created it mistakely. then create assignments folder and articles folder which is usedto save our daily assignments and upload to the github. Then we setup to upload the day1 article via these commands

	* git init
	* git remote add orgin "copy the link of github assignment and paste here"
	* git pull 
	* git config --global username "bennny7774"
	* git config --global password "**********"
	* git add .
	* git commit -m " Day1.m2"
	* git push -u orgin HEAD:main
And i go and asked assignment to my mentor Jatin, He gives assignment "how tcp/ip works in whatsapp" and going to do that assignment.
