	Today my mentor jatin came to office and gives another assign about IT Asset Inventory Management Tools then i start to take the notes for assignments.Then search about the inventory tools from google search and i found the result of google which are informative to me. Then I understand the IT Asset Inventory Management Tools which are used to manage and track the devices for the company. It is mainly to monitor and diagnostic the hardware and to analysis performance and how they utilize the assets. They are many software are available in the market. Then i try understand it but can't each performs in different features.

	Then we are going daily sessions. Today, we learn about Problem solving before that we play word puzzle which If mentor says "red" at the what was gone on mind is the answer of the word, I answered "Fire Truck" then mentor says "bottle" i answered "blood" then he says "current" again answered but this time i answered two came out of my mind which are "amphere" and "flow of electron" but the mentor takes only one that was "amphere" . Then we are going to leran about problem solving.

	The First problem is gave the mentor which was " Starting configuration for the Quarrasi lock problem. You must slide for the Kratzz bars, currently in the right receptor, to the left receptor without setting off either alarm. A sensor is lit when an even number of star-shaped Quinicrys appear in the column above, and an alarm sounds if exactly one connected sensor lights up. Suppressors can keep an alarm from sounding, bit only for the receptor where you are standing" and the mentor gives time to solve the problem for 15 minutes. In this problem we have certain conditions and rules to solve the problem.

	The Mentor gives extra one tip for problem solving

		* Most constrained port
		* Trial and error
		* Breakdown the problem
		* Stratergy
	The new tip is
		* Look for analyze

	Me and teammate are discussed and try to solve the problem but we stack and again we are trying to solve the problem from differnt ways and again we stack and can't solve the problem by me and my teammates. Then mentor came and ask us what is solution for the problem and we said "we didn't find the answer" then ha gave an idea with the old problem which was given by yeaterday and we try to solve the problem by the given solution but we got a solution which is we are going to submit in the today's session. 

	Then mentor gave another problem which was a city named as " KONIGSBERG " in "Prussia" which is doesn't exist now in the world. The Problem which was the consists of four blocks named as " A, B, C, D" and they are 7 bridges which are named as " a, b, c, d, e, f, g "  which are connected each other block. Bridge "a" is connect block "A" and block "B", Bridge "b" is also connect Block "A" and "B". Bridge "c" is connect Block "A" and Block "C" and Bridge "d" is also connect block "A" and "C". Bridge "e" is connect block "C" and block "D". Bridge "f" is connect block "A" and block "D".Bridge "g" is connect block "B" and block "D".

	The problem is a man start  walking and he must cross all bridge one time only. So, me and my teamamtes are ready solve the problem then find solution " He can't cross all bridges, there is a bridge which he didn't cross. So, that man can't cross the all the bridges. " 

 	The mentor give some solution for problems in software

		* Scability Problem - limited capability of the network to handle large amounts of transaction data
		* Resource constraint problem - sub - class of the scheduling problem
		* Domain Problem - area of expertise or application to analyze and solve problem

	Then my mentor ask about the assignment and i was researching and understand what is asset inventory management tool and how it function in an organization but i can't select which is best software.
