<h1>Day6</h1>

<p>I learned today was computer, what is computer and evolution of computers.</p>

<p>The evolution of computers</p>
<ol>
<li>Mechnical Computer</li>
<li>Electrical  Computer</li>
<li>Electronic Computer</li>
<li>Quantum Computers</li>
</ol>


<h2>Mechanical Computer</h2>

<p>	It is work under the process of Mechanical gears, levers rather than electronic components.</p>

<h2>Electrical Computer</h2>

<p>	It is work from the basics of "ON" and "OFF" switch process.</p>
<p>	It consists of 8 switches to represent the 8 bit.</p>

<h2>Electronic Computer</h2>

<p>	It is work form the basics of "1" and "0" and made of million transistors</p>

<h2>Quantum Computers</h2>

<p>	It is still in research which is used quantum physics to store the data and information.</p>

<h2>Why a byte consists of 8 bits</h2>

<p>	Because of the ASCII character sets because numerical system is consists base of "2"</p>


<p>I learned about OS which is used for the translation layer to write the command.</p>


<h2>Number System</h2>

<p>	Here i learned about the number system which are used for long time ago in the world</p>
<ul>
<li>	Uniary which consists of "i i i i i i i" it is used represent the number " i ii iii iv v vi vii viii xi x xii xiii xiv xv "</li>

<li>		Binary which consists of only "0" and "1"<\li>
		
<li>		Decimal number consists of " 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9" </li>

<li>		Base 12, Base 16 ( HexaDecimal 0 to 9 A to F ), Base 24, Base 32</li>

<h2>The Mentor gave the problem</h2>

<p>	You have machine in hand which is used calculating and you have to teach how to add ( 4,6 )</p>
