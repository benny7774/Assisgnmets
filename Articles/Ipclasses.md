# What is ip

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to the devices connected to a computer network that uses the IP for communication.

# Classes of IP


Class	      Address Range	Subnet masking	Example IP	Leading bits	Max number of networks	      Application

IP Class A	1 to 126	255.0.0.0	1.1.1.1  	8	              128	              Used for large number of hosts.

IP Class B	128 to 191	255.255.0.0	128.1.1.1	16	             16384	              Used for medium size network.

IP Class C	192 to 223	255.255.255.0	192.1.1.1 	24	             2097157	              Used for local area network.

IP Class D	224 to 239	    NA	           NA	        NA	                NA	              Reserve for multi-tasking.

IP Class E	240 to 254	    NA	           NA	        NA	                NA	              This class is reserved for research and Development Purposes.
