	I learned about the evolution of computers which are classified into four types. They are Mechanical Computers, Electrical Computers, Electronic Computers and Quantum Computers. Mechanical computers are first generation of computer which all are works in gears and levers. Electrical computers are works in switches which functioning in ON or Off state only. Electronics Computers are works in million of Transistors and it uses binary code as machine language and those code are 0's and 1's. Quantum computers are developing and testing. Why 1 byte consists of 8 bytes because of universal need single binary language in all machines. So, we need ASCII which consists of 8 bits and it have unique value for each letter in english alphabets both Captial and small letters, The number system is used for the computers to show the numbers and other lanuguage are created by the unicode which is contains or represented the other languages and the electronics circuits, registers, gates which are used in the elctronic computers as hardware of the computer and it functions are done by the Electronics.
