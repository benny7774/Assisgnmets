# Day25

		I have learned array can store values of any primitive data type, So an arrays consist of strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other arrays. Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value. I learned about the if, else and else-if conditions and how to use these condition in the program. When we need complicated problem we can use the else or else if.

		There are different methods in an Array

			* push():It will add the value at end of the array.

			* shift():It will Delete the value at first value of the array.

			* pop():It will delete the last value in the array.
			
			* unshift():It will add the value at start of the array.


	Then i have learned to create code for problem solving problem in a javascript.
