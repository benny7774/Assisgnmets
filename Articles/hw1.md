## Why not ascending?
	In the ascending method of solution, the numbers has a certain limit of reaching and hence the numbers get over which makes the result unattainable. That is the larger numbers are leftover without having a proper number to be added with. So, if mixed and taken, we will be able to reach a proper result.

# Which method is effective?
	The most effective method is the result where the constrains are solved in the easiest manner but with a proper methodology. It can be in any order. Mathematically solving to achieve the result rather than just trial and error method would be much more effective and time saving.

# Is this result possible for all numbers?
	This result is possible for all numbers as the numbers have equal space in between and this the method of bracketing and distributing will work out. The results are not dependent on the set of numbers given but on the methodolgy we need to follow.
