	Today mentor conducted cultural talks which is most useful for our day to day life. It is help to find our solution in different mind set people as a team. In the cultural talks i recollect all past cultural talks speech which is freedom, freewill and responsibility and getting into the new topic which is five phases of adult development by the Maslow's Hierarchy which consists of Self actualision, esteem, love/belonging, safety and physiological. Mentor assign five members of team and gave a task about person given a task more than he/she thinks can manage and a person with a conflictual close relationship in these two tasks apply the acruistion of skills which are impulsive mind, imperaial mind, socalise mind, self-constraint mind and self-trans mind.

	With my team members we discused about the how we figure out the solution then we strated to talk our own opinion on the first question 

		* In Impulsive mind -  the person willing to the job and without thinking about the consequences

		* In Imperial mind -  Why me ? I have a lot of work to do. He is targeting me only.

		* In Socalized mind -  If i don't do this my boss will think bad of me.

		* In Self-Authority -  The person has growth mindset (growth with pressure)

		* In Self-transforming -  Work sincerely without washing time and spend time with family

	For the second question our solution is

		* In Impulsive mind - Don't care about their feelings looking for a way to end it.

		* In Imperial mind  - I asked you to do something. It is important to me. I won't care how it affects you 

		* In Socalized mind - Act like nothing is wrong in a community.

		* In Self-authority - Conflicts are a part of relationships

		* In Self-transforming - Accept for who they are.
