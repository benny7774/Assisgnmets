<p> Our mentor came to office and ask about the assignment which was gave yeasterday. I said, i didn't solve the problem and the mentor solved the constraints by applying the " Euler's Graphplot theory " and he taught as  whether check the problem which is to analyze and check it solve.
	By these problem we get to analyze the problem which is solvable or not, by making the constrainst will able to know what to do.</p>
<p>Then the mentor gave another problem to solve the pentriod which was draw in single stroke and it must touch one point at one time and it can't touch twice in a single point. then we analyze and solve  as team. that i solved by simple solution which i draw in a single stroke and i get the answer.
